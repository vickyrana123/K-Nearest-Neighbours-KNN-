# K-Nearest-Neighbours(KNN

The project aims to implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classifying iris flowers based on their features. The Iris dataset contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of three different species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).
